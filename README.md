This is a simple assignment answer for the odin project.

Now if I upload it to Repl.it it looks at ./ .html as the file path by default and hence shows 404. This can obviously be solved by hardcoding each file path
but i think that boring as this can be done much faster in express. Anyway the code provided above works fine in a simple folder.
Also the Assignment itself says /about should take me to about


Make a project directory and create the following files inside that directory:
index.html
about.html
contact-me.html
404.html
Create your node.js server file index.js and add the code needed to serve the right page according to the url.
localhost:8080 should take users to index.html
localhost:8080/about should take users to about.html
localhost:8080/contact-me should take users to contact-me.html
404.html should display any time the user tries to go to a page not listed above.
